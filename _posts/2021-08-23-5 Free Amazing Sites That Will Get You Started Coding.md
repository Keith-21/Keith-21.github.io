<font size="4">As machine learning and Artificial Intelligence have been increasingly getting popular recently, many people try to learn how to code. Personally speaking, nowadays, it is so much easier to learn how to code by yourself! So, let's look into 5 awesome sites that will help you on your coding journey!</font>



The order is randomly chosen.

### **1.** [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

<font size="4">W3Schools is an amazing platform where you could learn the basics of Python, HTML, Javascript, and more. Whatever you choose to learn, for sure you can get the most important basics you need to learn for that programming language.</font>

<font size="4">More than that, it provides section exercises where you can practice the things you learn as you progress. Since it has very clear examples and documentation like articles, it is also a good reference for checking exact syntaxes or other formats that you might have forgotten. Furthermore, it provides good "how-to" examples so that many beginners could try taking on a small project on their own. </font>

<font size="4">Recently, they have added a new section where it gives video lessons for learning HTML, which is great! But it costs $9.99.</font>





#### Pros: Free, many good examples and resources

#### Cons: More of a reading guide, not a video course





### **2.** [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)

<font size="4">Similar to W3Schools, Codecademy provides Web-Dev-related programming languages like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. But also, it has many programming language choices such as C++, Go, and Ruby. Furthermore, Codecademy organizes its courses by subject such as Cybersecurity, Web Design, or Machine Learning. So, it not only teaches the basics of many programming languages but it goes deep into subjects like Game Development, Data Visualization, or Mobile Development. </font>



<font size="4">Codecademy organized their courses according to the difficulties of the learning curve, so it will allow the beginners to have an exciting and clear experience in learning new skills instead of stressing out for learning too advanced level courses. Also, Codecademy has great built-in practice exercises with explanations that allow a close to a real experience of coding to the users.</font>



#### Pros: Many beginner courses are free, great practice exercises

#### Cons: Not a video course, some advanced courses are not free



### 3. [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

​																						Taken from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

----

<font size="4">Well, you can tell that it is obviously free by looking at the name of the website. However, that does not mean that the contents in freeCodeCamp are low quality. By no means. Again, like the previous sites, it provides a variety of programming language courses. </font>



<font size="4">But more than other things, I found **this** to be really helpful. So, if you sign up to the website or sign up for the email, you would receive an email weekly from Quincy Larson, [the founder of freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/quincylarson/). The email contains really helpful and interesting topics and programming courses. And I genuinely like receiving these emails, unlike from other places xD. </font> 



#### Pros: FREE, awesome emails, many video courses

#### Cons: Some might not like the UI of the website





### 4. [Khan Academy CS courses](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing)

![image-20210822155203649](C:\Users\Kipung\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210822155203649.png)

​																							Taken from [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing)

----

<font size="4">Khan Academy is already well-known for its free and great quality content for a variety of subjects such as Math, Science, Test Prep, History, and even Life Skills. Even though the Khan Academy CS courses are not recommended for intermediate or advanced programmers, to those who just began to learn how to write a "Hello World!" program, the courses are just for you! </font>



<font size="4">Unlike other websites, Khan Academy CS courses have Video-Practice combined lessons. You might be confused about what I am saying, but literally, they have mixed up the practice itself and the video lesson together. So, if I play a lesson video that talks about how to make a circle in Javascript, you also get to write that exact Javascript code. This might be a little different than other platforms, but I strongly recommend for beginners to try out! </font>



#### Pros: FREE, engaging video-practice lessons

#### Cons: Some might not like the video-practice lessons





### 5. [edX](https://www.edx.org/)

![image-20210822184044289](C:\Users\Kipung\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210822184044289.png)

----

<font size="4">Like Khan Academy, edX has a variety of courses ranging from Robotics to Literature. But of course, we are focusing on programming courses. Unlike most of the previous websites, edX provides video lessons and sometimes articles too. </font>



<font size="4">Apart from the great video lessons, one of the great benefits of edX is the course providers or instructors because many of them are from prestigious universities such as MIT, Harvard, and Berkeley.</font>



#### Pros: With auditing it is free, Great course providers or instructors 

#### Cons: To receive a certificate and full course experience, payment needed







### Extra - YouTube

<font size="4">I don't think I need to explain much here.</font>

<font size="4">Whether you have Youtube premium or just choose to watch some ads, you could access countless video lessons from all around the world. My only caution here is that you might be drowning in the ocean of too much information. If you are a beginner, try to choose a very basic level or something like an introduction. </font>







### Conclusion

<font size="4">I personally have used all of these websites when I began to learn how to code. (still learning xD). I thoroughly enjoyed this one course from edX. It was called "Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)" by MichiganX. I think it was provided by the University of Michigan. And I loved this instructor called Charles Severance. He is an amazing instructor! I really recommend you to begin your programming journey with him! </font>



<font size="4">Honestly, all of these websites are great sources of information and good reference points. Try all of them! And no pressure, because they are all free! :)</font>



<font size="4">And that is it for today! See you next time!</font>
