<font size="4">You probably heard about the new Windows 11 update. And if you are a PC user you might be wondering wether my device could get the new update. </font>

<br />

<font size="4">If you have been following the recent updates, you know that there are a lot of confusions and unclearness. Well, recently on August 27, about 2 days ago, there was a new update about Windows 11 on the [Windows Blog](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/08/27/update-on-windows-11-minimum-system-requirements-and-the-pc-health-check-app/).</font>

<br />

<font size="4">Basically, the original minimum system requirement didn't change much from having the <u>64-bit processors, 4 GB of memory, 64 GB of storage, UEFI secure boot, graphics requirement and TPM 2.0</u> according to the blog. However, they did mention that they have added a few number of additional processor list. And those additions are the following:</font>

- Intel® Core™ X-series, Xeon® W-series
- Only some Intel® Core™ 7820HQ that have modern drivers based on DCH design principles

<br />

<font size="4">Also, they have released a new version of the <u>[PC Health Check app](https://aka.ms/GetPCHealthCheckInsiders)</u> to Windows Insiders. Basically, this app checks whether your device is eligible for Windows 11. </font>

<br />

<font size="4">If you want to check the specific System requirements, go to the official Windows 11 System requirements [page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11-specifications#primaryR2). It shows more details such as the requirements for the display and the graphics card. </font>

<br />

<font size="4">Despite all these requirements and some anxieties, there is at least one great news. The Internet Explorer is disabled! (However, Microsoft is kind of pushing hard about the Microsoft Edge as their browser.)</font>

<br />
<br />



### What if my device is not eligible?

<font size="4">First, I want to say that don't worry too much, yet. As I read and watched other people say about this, and if my understanding is right, even if your device doesn't meet the requirements "Technically", you still can have other ways around. </font>

<br />

<font size="4">And if those other ways do not work for you, the best option is just sticking with Windows 10 unfortunately. Microsoft have announced that they will support Windows 10 through October 14, 2025. So, it isn't so bad. Just when you buy a new PC in the future, make sure that it has Windows 11 on the device or at least it passes the minimum requirements.</font>

<br />

<font size="4">That's it for today, see you next time!</font>
